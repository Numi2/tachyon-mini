 incentive structures for Tachyon + Zcash that align with privacy, recursion, indistinguishability.

important constraint etc
no design should leak whether someone is aggregator vs normal wallet user or leak usage patterns rewards must be blind or uniform if rewards correlate too tightly with usage for example per transaction then timing or size can be correlated to real identities

Wallet incentives + dev grants

1. Wallet ux 


1. user transaction rewards
	•	wallet auto-tags shielded + recursion transactions for eligibility
	•	reward claims batched per epoch, shown as “privacy rewards available”
	•	user presses claim → wallet generates blind voucher proof → receives tokens without revealing which tx

2. staking and long-lock delegation
	•	wallet has staking tab
	•	user picks validator and optional lock period (eg 6m, 12m)
	•	wallet shows expected yield + bonus multiplier for recursion lock
	•	rewards accrue automatically, with “claim” button

3. proof aggregation participation
	•	wallet can opportunistically batch local spends into one proof
	•	if it aggregates others’ proofs, it earns vouchers redeemable for rewards
	•	ux: background process, user only sees “aggregation rewards” balance

4. sync / relay vouchers
	•	wallet connects to sync services to fetch state updates
	•	in return it earns blind vouchers proving participation
	•	ux: transparent, user just sees occasional “sync rewards” credited

5. reward claim center
	•	one screen consolidates privacy rewards, staking yield, aggregation, sync rewards
	•	user clicks claim all → wallet constructs zk/ blind proofs → tokens appear
	•	all claims are batched and anonymized so timing cannot be linked

so ux is minimal: wallet quietly collects vouchers in background, shows total rewards in one place, lets user claim with one tap. staking and delegation are explicit tabs, but transaction and sync rewards are automatic. validator bonuses and dev grants remain outside wallet.
