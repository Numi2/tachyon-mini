	Recursive proof definition: each block or wallet state proof verifies the previous proof inside the circuit, so validation cost stays constant while proof depth grows.
	
 both the global ledger and each wallet can be represented by a single, small, recursively updated proof that attests to complete history correctness and state validity while preserving full privacy.
